\section{Lit notes}

Reich et al 1992, for seedlings, negative relationship leaf lifespan and LAR. This is different from our results, since SLM is nearly proportional to leaf lifespan, and we found no relationship between LAR and SLM (but do they have all the PFTs??). However, across stands, positive relationship between leaf biomass and leaf lifespan, which is consistent with our results.

Cornelissen et al 1996 positive relationship SLA and LAR, but this is for tiny seedlings harvested 21 days after first leaf appearance. But check references and who cites this!

\cite{friend_carbon_2014} showed that 30\% of the uncertainty in global vegetation carbon simulated with seven vegetation models is due to the residence time of carbon in vegetation. This residence time depends on turnover rates of the various plant pools, and hence also on the distribution of biomass between these pools. For example, vegetation with a higher leaf mass fraction will have a lower overall residence time of carbon.

\cite{de2014does} "We have shown that allocation approaches that are constrained by biomass fractions (such as functional relationships) were more successful at capturing observed trends, and were generally more robust, than approaches based on allocation coefficients."

\cite{friedlingstein_toward_1999} make no mention of plant functional type differences or the need to vary allocation by pft.

\cite{givnish_adaptive_2002} discusses costs and benefits of evergreen vs. deciduous habit, in terms of constructing a growth model that takes into account photosynthesis, leaf lifespan, belowground costs. However he does not consider or report on differences in allocation associated with leaf lifespan. Instead he simply states that 'leaf allocation ratio' relates to leaf lifespan, which of course is only true if total leaf mass is constant.

\cite{callaway_biomass_1994} example of lower leaf mass / sapwood area for desert population of PIPO vs. montane population. For pointing out small-scale climatic effects on allometry (that may not be obvious in global scale analyses).

\cite{poorter_biomass_2012} found a slightly larger LMF in gymnosperms, but the difference was small and could not split between deciduous and evergreen angiosperms due to a lack of data. They argue that "most conifers retain leaves for two or more years. Thus, the higher LMF may simply be the consequence of leaf longevity rather than higher assimilate partitioning per se. In this way, conifers are able to compensate for their lower physiological activity per gram of leaf." This raises the question whether LMF differs by angiosperms and gymnosperms, or as a consequence of leaf longevity (especially deciduous vs. evergreen).

Also, data are mostly for very small plants, eg. 1g. Some data up to 10kg, but gymnos and angios converge.

\cite{enquist_global_2002} report 2.6 times higher leaf mass at given stem mass for conifers compared to angiosperms, but did not separate further, nor interpreted this difference in terms of SLA. Their interpretation is 'that conifers typically retain three cohorts of leaves that have less well-developed [...] mesophyll'. Not sure how that latter bit makes sense, and leaf lifespan interpretation is no good; because it still begs the question why would conifers not simply have 1/3 less leaf mass per cohort?

\cite{mccarthy_consistency_2007} further demonstrate large difference in LMF between angiosperms and conifers, and note that a large chunk of the residuals is correlated with SLA and LL. They interpret this rather vaguely as 'leaf morphology may constrain leaf mass distribution'. Their SLA was not on the same individuals, but they could have calculated PFT average LAR anyway, but did not.

\cite{oneill_comparative_1981} reported much higher leaf biomass for gymnosperms vs. angiosperms, at a given woody biomass increment. This means (as Niklas reported) a much higher productivity per unit leaf biomass for angiosperms.

Serious lack of biomass data to constrain models. Studies like \cite{wolf_forest_2011} resort to studying individual tree allometry based on dividing stand biomass by stand density. \cite{wolf_allometric_2010} did not find any differences in biomass fractions (root,stem,leaf) between angiosperms and gymnosperms (but again this was based on stand biomass data, but still this is strange!).

\cite{hui_near_2014} Isometric scaling of above vs. belowground biomass in chinese forest biomass database.

\cite{sardans_tree_2013} report similiar LMF for evergreen angio. and gymnosperms, and ca. 40\% less leaf mass for decid. angio. Local study, 3000 plots in Catalonia.

\cite{reich_temperature_2014} "On average, when standardized for MAT and Mstem, conifers tended to have more Mfol and less Mroot than angiosperm forests". Their Fig. 2 shows trends in LMF with MAT etc., in bins of stem size. Also allometric analysis with MAT as covariate, showing significance of MAT. For Angiosperms, our explanation would be that evergreen angio is more common at high MAT. But what about conifers?

\cite{cairns_root_1997} found no difference in root-shoot ratio between gymno and angio.

\cite{delucia_climate-driven_2000} LA/SA decreases with summer VPD for Pinus but not non-Pinus gymno. Also Pinus has much lower LA/SA than non-Pinus; suggesting that we should separate gymnosperms into those groups as well.


\cite{grier_notes:_1974} early study on leaf mass proportionality to sapwood area (and uses mass not area).

Idea that conifers have more leaf area, especially later in life and as large trees -

* Bond - assumes gymnos build up large leaf areas, cites Waring & Franklin, 1979; Chabot & Hicks, 1982; Schulze et al., 1986
* Chabot & Hicks, 1982 - again assumes conifers: *The canopies of many conifers contain several cohorts of leaves. In these cases, long leaf life spans allow the accumulation of a large total leaf area through incremental investments spread over several years. Other species maintain an evergreen canopy by periodically replacing leaves during the course of a year.*
* Schulze et al., 1986 - little evidence

From @dekauwe2014:

- Jones et al. (2013) showed a large spread in the simulated change in the land C-store of between ~250 and 400 Pg C by 2100 from a series of model simulations run as part of the Coupled Model Inter- comparison Project (CMIP5).
- Most recently, Friend et al. (2014) attributed uncertainty in multi-model predictions of the future vegetation store to differ- ent residence times in models.
