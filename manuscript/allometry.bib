	abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass ({AGB}). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees = 5 cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of {AGB} of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5?6.5\% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

* Here, we synthesize data on component {GPP} fluxes from a worldwide forest database to determine the allocation patterns of {GPP} across global gradients in climate and nitrogen deposition (Ndep).


* Our results reveal that allocation of {GPP} is governed in an integrated way by allometric constraints and by three trade-offs among {GPP} components: wood production ({NPPwood}) vs fine-root production ({NPPfroot}), {NPPwood} vs foliage production ({NPPfoliage}), and autotrophic respiration (Ra) vs all biomass production components. Component fluxes were explained more by allometry, while partitioning to components was related more closely to the trade-offs. Elevated temperature and Ndep benefit long-term woody biomass C sequestration by stimulating allometric partitioning to wood. Ndep can also enhance forest C use efficiency by its effects on the Ra vs biomass production trade-off. Greater precipitation affects C allocation by driving the {NPPwood} vs {NPPfoliage} trade-off toward the latter component.


* These results advance our understanding about the global constraints on {GPP} allocation in forest ecosystems and its climatic responses, and are therefore valuable for simulations and projections of ecosystem C sequestration.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Prior work has shown that above- and below-ground dry biomass across individual plants scale in a near isometric manner across phyletically and ecologically diverse species. Allometric theory predicts that a similar isometric scaling relationship should hold true across diverse forest-types, regardless of vegetational composition.
Methods To test this hypothesis, two compendia for forest-level above- and below-ground dry biomass per hectare ({MA} and {MR}, respectively) were examined to test the hypothesis that {MA} vs. {MR} scales isometrically and in the same manner as reported for data from individual plants. Model Type {II} regression protocols were used to compare the numerical values of {MA} vs. {MR} scaling exponents (i.e. slopes of log?log linear relationships) for the combined data sets (n =1534), each of the two data sets, and data sorted into a total of 17 data subsets for community- and biome-types as well as communities dominated by angiosperms or conifers.
Key Results Among the 20 regressions examined, 15 had scaling exponents that were indistinguishable from that reported for {MA} vs. {MR} across individual plants. The isometric hypothesis could not be strictly rejected on statistical grounds; four of these 15 exponents had broad 95\% confidence intervals resulting from small sample sizes. Significant variation was observed in the y-intercepts of the 20 regression curves, because of absolute differences in {MA} or {MR}.
Conclusions The allometries of forest- and individual plant-level {MA} vs. {MR} relationships share strikingly similar scaling exponents, but differ because of considerable variation in y-intercepts. These results support prior allometric theory and provide boundary conditions for the scaling of {MA} and {MR}.},

In the present study, a general allometric model was derived to predict the relationships among the stem biomass {MS}, aboveground biomass {MA} and total biomass {MT}, based on previously developed scaling relationships for leaf, stem and root standing biomass. The model predicted complex scaling exponents for {MT} and/or {MA} with respect to {MS}. Because annual biomass accumulation in the stem, root and branch far exceeded the annual increase in standing leaf biomass, we can predict that {MT}?{MA}?{MSas} a simple result of the model. Although slight variations existed in different phyletic affiliations (i.e. conifers versus angiosperms), empirical results using Model Type {II} (reduced major axis) regression supported the model's predictions. The predictive formulas among stem, aboveground and total biomass were obtained using Model Type I (ordinary least squares) regression to estimate forest biomass. Given the low mean percentage prediction errors for aboveground (and total biomass) based on the stem biomass, the results provided a reasonable method to estimate the biomass of forests at the individual level, which was insensitive to the variation in local environmental conditions (e.g. precipitation, temperature, etc.).},

	abstract = {Recent advances in allometric theory have proposed a novel quantitative framework by which to view the evolution of plant form and function. This general theory has placed strong emphasis on the importance of long-distance transport in shaping the evolution of many attributes of plant form and function. Specifically, it is hypothesized that with the evolutionary increase in plant size natural selection has also resulted in vascular networks that minimize scaling of total hydrodynamic resistance associated with increasing transport distances. Herein the central features of this theory are reviewed and a broad sampling of supporting but yet preliminary empirical data are analysed. In particular, subtle attributes of the scaling of tracheid and vessel anatomy are hypothesized to be crucial for the evolution of increased plant size. Furthermore, the importance of minimizing hydrodynamic resistance associated with increased transport distances is also hypothesized to be reflected in an isometric scaling relationship between stem mass, {MS} and root mass, {MR}(i.e. {MS} ? {MR}). Preliminary data from multiple extant and fossil plant taxa provide tantalizing evidence supporting the predicted relationships. Together, these results suggest that selection for the minimization of the scaling of hydrodynamic resistance within plant vascular networks has in turn allowed for the enormous diversification in vascular plant size.},

	abstract = {The distribution of assimilated carbon among the plant parts has a profound effect on plant growth, and at a larger scale, on terrestrial biogeochemistry. Although important progress has been made in modelling photosynthesis, less effort has been spent on understanding the carbon allocation, especially at large spatial scales. Whereas several individual-level models of plant growth include an allocation scheme, most global terrestrial models still assume constant allocation of net primary production ({NPP}) among plant parts, without any environmental coupling. Here, we use the {CASA} biosphere model as a platform for exploring a new global allocation scheme that estimates allocation of photosynthesis products among leaves, stems, and roots depending on resource availability. The philosophy underlying the model is that allocation patterns result from evolved responses that adjust carbon investments to facilitate capture of the most limiting resources, i.e. light, water, and mineral nitrogen. In addition, we allow allocation of {NPP} to vary in response to changes in atmospheric {CO}2. The relative magnitudes of changes in {NPP} and resource-use efficiency control the response of root:shoot allocation. For ambient {CO}2, the model produces realistic changes in above-ground allocation along productivity gradients. In comparison to the {CASA} standard estimate using fixed allocation ratios, the new allocation scheme tends to favour root allocation, leading to a 10\% lower global biomass. Elevated {CO}2, which alters the balance between growth and available resources, generally leads to reduced water stress and consequently, decreased root:shoot ratio. The major exception is forest ecosystems, where increased nitrogen stress induces a larger root allocation.},

Seven global vegetation models are used to analyze possible responses to future climate simulated by a range of general circulation models run under all four representative concentration pathway scenarios of changing concentrations of greenhouse gases. All 110 simulations predict an increase in global vegetation carbon to 2100, but with substantial variation between vegetation models. For example, at 4 ?C of global land surface warming (510?758 ppm of {CO}2), vegetation carbon increases by 52?477 Pg C (224 Pg C mean), mainly due to {CO}2 fertilization of photosynthesis. Simulations agree on large regional increases across much of the boreal forest, western Amazonia, central Africa, western China, and southeast Asia, with reductions across southwestern North America, central South America, southern Mediterranean areas, southwestern Africa, and southwestern Australia. Four vegetation models display discontinuities across 4 ?C of warming, indicating global thresholds in the balance of positive and negative influences on productivity and biomass. In contrast to previous global vegetation model studies, we emphasize the importance of uncertainties in projected changes in carbon residence times. We find, when all seven models are considered for one representative concentration pathway ? general circulation model combination, such uncertainties explain 30\% more variation in modeled vegetation carbon change than responses of net primary productivity alone, increasing to 151\% for non-{HYBRID}4 models.

We review the available evidence and examine the potential problems that arise in the interpretation of this relationship. In particular, we reveal how few studies investigating patterns of diameter?height allometry in trees have adequately controlled for neighbour effects. We also demonstrate how the interpretation of diameter?height allometry has suffered from a lack of uniformity in the selection of regression models, and how the use of least squares regression to estimate allometric scaling exponents can be biased. We conclude that most of the published data on static diameter?height relationships in trees tell us virtually nothing about either age (developmental) effects or neighbour effects; they are completely confounded. Further studies are required to analyse the long-term dynamic growth trajectories of individual trees in relation to local neighbour effects, and greater effort must be made to establish the consistent use of unbiased statistical methods between studies.},

	abstract = {Based on the isometric hypothesis, belowground plant biomass ({MB}) should scale isometrically with aboveground biomass ({MA}) and the scaling exponent should not vary with environmental factors. We tested this hypothesis using a large forest biomass database collected in China. Allometric scaling functions relating {MB} and {MA} were developed for the entire database and for different groups based on tree age, diameter at breast height, height, latitude, longitude or elevation. To investigate whether the scaling exponent is independent of these biotic and abiotic factors, we analyzed the relationship between the scaling exponent and these factors. Overall {MB} was significantly related to {MA} with a scaling exponent of 0.964. The scaling exponent of the allometric function did not vary with tree age, density, latitude, or longitude, but varied with diameter at breast height, height, and elevation. The mean of the scaling exponent over all groups was 0.986. Among 57 scaling relationships developed, 26 of the scaling exponents were not significantly different from 1. Our results generally support the isometric hypothesis. {MB} scaled near isometrically with {MA} and the scaling exponent did not vary with tree age, density, latitude, or longitude, but increased with tree size and elevation. While fitting a single allometric scaling relationship may be adequate, the estimation of {MB} from {MA} could be improved with size-specific scaling relationships.},

	abstract = {Estimates of national-scale forest carbon (C) stocks and fluxes are typically based on allometric regression equations developed using dimensional analysis techniques. However, the literature is inconsistent and incomplete with respect to large-scale forest C estimation. We compiled all available diameter-based allometric regression equations for estimating total aboveground and component biomass, defined in dry weight terms, for trees in the United States. We then implemented a modified meta-analysis based on the published equations to develop a set of consistent, national-scale aboveground biomass regression equations for U.S. species. Equations for predicting biomass of tree components were developed as proportions of total aboveground biomass for hardwood and softwood groups. A comparison with recent equations used to develop large-scale biomass estimates from U.S. forest inventory data for eastern U.S. species suggests general agreement (?30\%) between biomass estimates. The comparison also shows that differences in equation forms and species groupings may cause differences at small scales depending on tree size and forest species composition. This analysis represents the first major effort to compile and analyze all available biomass literature in a consistent national-scale framework. The equations developed here are used to compute the biomass estimates used by the model {FORCARB} to develop the U.S. C budget. {FOR}. {SCI}. 49(1):12?35.},

	abstract = {Carbon allocation plays a critical role in forest ecosystem carbon cycling. We reviewed existing literature and compiled annual carbon budgets for forest ecosystems to test a series of hypotheses addressing the patterns, plasticity, and limits of three components of allocation: biomass, the amount of material present; flux, the flow of carbon to a component per unit time; and partitioning, the fraction of gross primary productivity ({GPP}) used by a component. Can annual carbon flux and partitioning be inferred from biomass? Our survey revealed that biomass was poorly related to carbon flux and to partitioning of photosynthetically derived carbon, and should not be used to infer either. Are component fluxes correlated? Carbon fluxes to foliage, wood, and belowground production and respiration all increased linearly with increasing {GPP} (a rising tide lifts all boats). Autotrophic respiration was strongly linked to production for foliage, wood and roots, and aboveground net primary productivity and total belowground carbon flux ({TBCF}) were positively correlated across a broad productivity gradient. How does carbon partitioning respond to variability in resources and environment? Within sites, partitioning to aboveground wood production and {TBCF} responded to changes in stand age and resource availability, but not to competition (tree density). Increasing resource supply and stand age, with one exception, resulted in increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to {TBCF}. Partitioning to foliage production was much less sensitive to changes in resources and environment. Overall, changes in partitioning within a site in response to resource supply and age were small ({\textless} 15\% of {GPP}), but much greater than those inferred from global relationships. Across all sites, foliage production plus respiration, and total autotrophic respiration appear to use relatively constant fractions of {GPP} - partitioning to both was conservative across a broad range of {GPP} - but values did vary across sites. Partitioning to aboveground wood production and to {TBCF} were the most variable - conditions that favored high {GPP} increased partitioning to aboveground wood production and decreased partitioning to {TBCF}. Do priorities exist for the products of photosynthesis? The available data do not support the concept of priorities for the products of photosynthesis, because increasing {GPP} increased all fluxes. All facets of carbon allocation are important to understanding carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystem models require information on partitioning, yet we found few studies that measured all components of the carbon budget to allow estimation of partitioning coefficients. Future studies that measure complete annual carbon budgets contribute the most to understanding carbon allocation.},

An implied assumption of this is that there are trade-offs in allocation between leaf, stem and root functions. * 2Recently, an alternative approach, allometric biomass partitioning theory ({APT}), was developed to predict how plants should divide their metabolic production between leaves, stems and roots, based on the constraints of body size. {APT} predicts that, for an allometrically ideal plant, leaf mass should scale to the 3/4th power of body size, and stem and root mass should scale isometrically to body size. * 3In this study, we combine {OPT} with {APT} by investigating biomass partitioning not accounted for by allometric constraints across broad environmental gradients. * 4Intraspecific variability in biomass allocation shows correlations with environmental factors that would be predicted by {OPT}. However, interspecifically, these patterns either do not appear or are greatly reduced. * 5Our study suggests that, after size is accounted for, intraspecific residual variation in biomass allocation may be partially explained by environmental factors in a manner consistent with {OPT}. However, the particular patterns vary between species, obscuring large-scale patterns. * 6In summary, differences due to environmental variability can be incorporated with allocation patterns related to total mass to help understand how plants should allocate biomass in response to changes in both size and environment.},

	abstract = {Understanding how plant biomass is distributed between roots, stems, and leaves is central to many questions in life-history evolution, ecology, and ecosystem studies. Current ecological dogma states that patterns of biomass partitioning result from environmental differences. However, there are methodological issues associated with the role of plant size. In addition, the importance of evolutionary history in biomass distribution is unclear. Here, we assess the relative importance of evolutionary history and growth form on how biomass not accounted for by plant size is partitioned between plant organs. Our analyses indicate that while growth form was significantly correlated with variation in biomass distribution and partitioning, phylogeny appears to be the strongest factor. Variation in biomass distribution is phylogenetically conserved for leaf mass but not for stems, roots, and annual production, suggesting that these factors may be more plastic. Leaf mass was the only organ with a considerable portion of the residual variation from growth form, which appears to be largely the result of differences in leaf traits. Our results have important implications for ecological studies because partitioning studies must first assess the role of plant size and evolutionary history in order to fully understand variability in biomass partitioning and distribution.},

Individuals of the annual plant species Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, and Polygonum pensylvanicum were grown from locally field-gathered seed in controlled greenhouse conditions across gradients of light, nutrients, and water. Frequent harvests were used to determine the growth and allocation (root vs. shoot, and leaf area vs. biomass) responses of these plants over a 57-d period. Growth analysis revealed that each species displayed significant plasticity in growth rates and substantial amounts of ontogenetic drift in root:shoot biomass ratios and ratios of leaf area to biomass across each of the three resource gradients. Ontogenetically controlled comparisons of root:shoot and leaf area ratios across light and nutrient gradients were generally consistent with predictions based on optimal partitioning theory; allocation to roots decreased and leaf area increased under low light and high nutrient conditions. These trends were confirmed, though were less dramatic, in allometric plots of biomass allocation throughout ontogeny. These species did not alter biomass allocation (beyond ontogenetic drift) in response to the broadly varying water regimes. Furthermore, many of the observed differences in biomass allocation were limited to a given time during growth and development. We conclude that, for these rapidly growing annual species, plasticity in biomass allocation patterns is only partially consistent with optimal partitioning theory, and that these plastic responses are ontogenetically constrained. Further, while these species did adjust biomass allocation patterns in response to light and nutrient availability, they did not adjust biomass allocation in response to water availability, despite dramatic plasticity in growth rates along all three resource gradients. Our results support a developmentally explicit model of plasticity in biomass allocation in response to limiting resources.},

The somatic dimensions of several species of animals and of a wide variety of trees fit this rule well.
It is a simple matter to show that energy metabolism during maximal sustained work depends on body cross-sectional area, not total body surface area as proposed by Rubner (1) and many after him. This result and the result requiring animal proportions to change with size amount to a derivation of Kleiber's law, a statement only empirical until now, correlating the metabolically related variables with body weight raised to the ? power. In the present model, biological frequencies are predicted to go inversely as body weight to the ? power, and total body surface areas should correlate with body weight to the ? power. All predictions of the proposed model are tested by comparison with existing data, and the fit is considered satisfactory.
In The Fire of Life, Kleiber (5) wrote "When the concepts concerned with the relation of body size and metabolic rate are clarified, . . . then compartive physiology of metabolism will be of great help in solving one of the most intricate and interesting problems in biology, namely the regulation of the rate of cell metabolism." Although Hill (23) realized that "the essential point about a large animal is that its structure should be capable of bearing its own weight and this leaves less play for other factors," he was forced to use an oversimplified "geometric similarity" hypothesis in his important work on animal locomotion and muscular dynamics. It is my hope that the model proposed here promises useful answers in comparisons of living things on both the microscopic and the gross scale, as part of the growing science of form, which asks precisely how organisms are diverse and yet again how they are alike.},

	abstract = {Insights into how terrestrial ecosystems affect the Earth's response to changes in climate and rising atmospheric {CO}2 levels rely heavily on the predictions of terrestrial biosphere models ({TBMs}). These models contain detailed mechanistic representations of biological processes affecting terrestrial ecosystems; however, their ability to simultaneously predict field-based measurements of terrestrial vegetation dynamics and carbon fluxes has remained largely untested. In this study, we address this issue by developing a constrained implementation of a new structured {TBM}, the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 ({ED}2), which explicitly tracks the dynamics of fine-scale ecosystem structure and function. Carbon and water flux measurements from an eddy-flux tower are used in conjunction with forest inventory measurements of tree growth and mortality at Harvard Forest (42.5?N, 72.1?W) to estimate a number of important but weakly constrained model parameters. Evaluation against a decade of tower flux and forest dynamics measurements shows that the constrained {ED}2 model yields greatly improved predictions of annual net ecosystem productivity, carbon partitioning, and growth and mortality dynamics of both hardwood and conifer trees. The generality of the model formulation is then evaluated by comparing the model's predictions against measurements from two other eddy-flux towers and forest inventories of the northeastern United States and Quebec. Despite the markedly different composition throughout this region, the optimized model realistically predicts observed patterns of carbon fluxes and tree growth. These results demonstrate how {TBMs} parameterized with field-based measurements can provide quantitative insight into the underlying biological processes governing ecosystem composition, structure, and function at larger scales.},

Model calculations of the daughter/mother ratio (i.e., the ratio of the total cross-sectional area of the daughter branches to the cross-sectional area of the mother branch at the branching point) showed that both biomechanical models agreed with da Vinci's rule when the branching angles of daughter branches and the weights of lateral daughter branches were small; however, the models deviated from da Vinci's rule as the weights and/or the branching angles of lateral daughter branches increased. The calculated values of the two models were largely similar but differed in some ways. Field measurements of Fagus crenata and Abies homolepis also fit this trend, wherein models deviated from da Vinci's rule with increasing relative weights of lateral daughter branches. However, this deviation was small for a branching pattern in nature, where empirical measurements were taken under realistic measurement conditions; thus, da Vinci's rule did not critically contradict the biomechanical models in the case of real branching patterns, though the model calculations described the contradiction between da Vinci's rule and the biomechanical models. The field data for Fagus crenata fit the uniform stress model best, indicating that stress uniformity is the key constraint of branch morphology in Fagus crenata rather than elastic similarity or da Vinci's rule. On the other hand, mechanical constraints are not necessarily significant in the morphology of Abies homolepis branches, depending on the number of daughter branches. Rather, these branches were often in agreement with da Vinci's rule.},

We also developed a set of alternative predictions that retained some assumptions of metabolic ecology while also considering how availability of a key limiting resource, light, changes with tree size. Our results show that there are no universal scaling relationships of growth or mortality with size among trees in tropical forests. Observed patterns were consistent with our alternative model in the one site where we had the data necessary to evaluate it, and were inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology in all forests.},

Here, we use allometric theory to predict the relationships among annual leaf, stem, and root growth rates ({GL}, {GS}, and {GR}, respectively) across a broad spectrum of seed plant species. Our model predicts isometric scaling relationships among all three organ growth rates: \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{L\}{\textbackslash},\}{\textbackslash}propto G\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{S\}{\textbackslash},\}{\textbackslash}propto G\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textbackslash},\}\$ . It also provides a conceptual basis for understanding the differences in the absolute amounts of biomass allocated to construct the three organ types. Analyses of a large compendium of biomass production rates across diverse seed plant species provide strong statistical support for the predictions of the theory and indicate that reproductive investments may scale isometrically with respect to vegetative organ growth rates. The general rules governing biomass allocation as indexed by the scaling exponents for organ growth rates are remarkably indifferent to plant size and taxonomic affiliation. However, the allometric ?constants? for these relationships differ numerically as a function of phenotypic features and local environmental conditions. Nonetheless, at the level of both inter- and intraspecific comparisons, the same proportional biomass allocation pattern holds across extant seed plant species.},

This concept remains engrained in the literature in the form of null hypotheses (or predictive models), despite numerous examples showing that the 2/3 and 8/3 rules are violated by small and intermediate-sized plants. Here, we present a growth-hydraulic model that provides more accurate and biologically realistic predictions of L and M. This model also sheds light on why L, D, and M scale differently across species and habitats as a result of differences in absolute size.},

	abstract = {The study of size and its biological consequences ? called allometry ? has fascinated biologists for centuries. Recent advances in this area of study have stimulated a renewed interest in these scaling phenomena, especially in terms of the search for mechanistic explanations that transcend mere descriptive phenomenology. These advances are reviewed in the context of plant biology. Allometric derivations are presented that predict how annual growth in total body biomass is partitioned to construct new leaf, stem, and root tissues at the level of an individual plant. Derivations are also presented to predict annual reproductive effort and to predict how the biomass of body parts changes as a function of the number of plants per unit area in communities. The predictions emerging from these derivations are then examined empirically by comparing predicted and observed scaling exponents for each relationship using a world-wide data compendium gathered from the primary literature. These comparisons provide strong statistical support for each of the allometric predictions. This support is taken as evidence that a general unifying allometric theory for plant biology is near at hand. Nevertheless, the validation of this theory requires much additional work and raises a number of procedural and conceptual concerns that must be resolved before a single?global?theory is accepted.},

Conclusions 38 * Acknowledgements 39 * References 39SummaryBiomass-partitioning patterns influence the functioning of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation at all levels, ranging from individual growth and reproduction to the flow of mass and energy through entire communities. For this reason, leaf, stem and root dry biomass-partitioning patterns across taxonomically and ecologically diverse seed plants (spermatophytes) have been intensively investigated, both empirically and theoretically. By contrast, phyletically disparate plants (e.g. green and brown algal macrophytes, mosses and pteridophytes) have not been examined to determine whether the partitioning of their body parts into ?leaf?, ?stem? and ?root? analogs accords with that of spermatophytes. In this review, the biomass-partitioning patterns of siphonous and brown algal macrophytes, mosses and pteridophytes were compared allometrically with those of spermatophytes and were shown to be largely in statistical accordance (thus lending support to the hypothesis that a single scaling relationship exists across eukaryotic photoautotrophs). This concordance is argued to support the hypothesis of functional equivalence across analogous, but developmentally different, body parts, a feature that permits the use of simpler biological model systems with which to derive analytical explanations for the biomass-partitioning patterns reported for more complex seed plants.},

We suggest a mechanism for this pattern, known as Corner?s Rules, based on universal scaling. We show similar crown area?stem diameter scaling between trunks and branches, environments, and species spanning a wide range of leaf size and stem biomechanics. If crown and stem maintain metabolically driven proportionality, but similar amounts of photosynthates are produced per unit crown area, then the greater leaf spacing in large-leaved species requires lower density stem tissue and, meeting mechanical needs, thicker stems. Congruent with this scenario, we show a negative relationship between leaf size and stem Young?s modulus. Corner?s Rules emerge from these mutual adjustments, which suggest that adaptive studies cannot consider any of these features independently. The constancy of scaling despite environmental challenges identifies this trait constellation as a crucial axis of plant diversification.},

Dose?response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves ({LMF}) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the {LMF}-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on {LMF} more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in {LMF} is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio ({SLA}). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

However, most efforts that claim to validate or invalidate {MTE} have focused on testing predictions. We argue that critical evaluation of {MTE} also requires strong tests of both its theoretical foundations and simplifying assumptions. To this end, we synthesise available information and find that {MTE}'s original derivations require additional assumptions to obtain the full scope of attendant predictions. Moreover, although some of {MTE}'s simplifying assumptions are well supported by data, others are inconsistent with empirical tests and even more remain untested. Further, although many predictions are empirically supported on average, work remains to explain the often large variability in data. We suggest that greater effort be focused on evaluating {MTE}'s underlying theory and simplifying assumptions to help delineate the scope of {MTE}, generate new theory and shed light on fundamental aspects of biological form and function.},

	abstract = {Whether the fraction of total forest biomass distributed in roots, stems, or leaves varies systematically across geographic gradients remains unknown despite its importance for understanding forest ecology and modeling global carbon cycles. It has been hypothesized that plants should maintain proportionally more biomass in the organ that acquires the most limiting resource. Accordingly, we hypothesize greater biomass distribution in roots and less in stems and foliage in increasingly arid climates and in colder environments at high latitudes. Such a strategy would increase uptake of soil water in dry conditions and of soil nutrients in cold soils, where they are at low supply and are less mobile. We use a large global biomass dataset ({\textgreater}6,200 forests from 61 countries, across a 40 ?C gradient in mean annual temperature) to address these questions. Climate metrics involving temperature were better predictors of biomass partitioning than those involving moisture availability, because, surprisingly, fractional distribution of biomass to roots or foliage was unrelated to aridity. In contrast, in increasingly cold climates, the proportion of total forest biomass in roots was greater and in foliage was smaller for both angiosperm and gymnosperm forests. These findings support hypotheses about adaptive strategies of forest trees to temperature and provide biogeographically explicit relationships to improve ecosystem and earth system models. They also will allow, for the first time to our knowledge, representations of root carbon pools that consider biogeographic differences, which are useful for quantifying whole-ecosystem carbon stocks and cycles and for assessing the impact of climate change on forest carbon dynamics.},

	abstract = {1. Plant organ biomass partitioning has been hypothesized to be driven by resources, such that species from drier environments allocate more biomass to roots than species from wetter environments to access water at greater soil depths. In savanna systems, fire may select for greater allocation to root biomass, especially in humid environments where fire is more frequent. Therefore, species from drier environments may have been under selection pressure to reach deeper soil water more effectively than species from humid environments, through faster root extension, more efficient depth penetration, and faster plant growth rates to respond rapidly to variable rainfall events.2. We compared biomass partitioning, root morphology traits [root extension rate, {RER}; specific taproot length ({STRL})] and relative growth rate ({RGR}) of seedlings of 51 savanna tree species, sampled from three continents (Africa, Australia and South America) in a greenhouse experiment. We used phylogenetically corrected and uncorrected analyses to compare the traits of the groups. We conducted a permanova on the combined traits to establish whether species could be distinguished on the basis of their combined traits.3. On average, species from humid environments allocated more biomass to roots and less to stems than species from semi-arid environments, consistent with the expectation that fire pressure selects for greater allocation to roots in humid environments. However, some species from humid environments had fast growth rates instead of high allocation to roots. Both {RER} and {STRL} were greater among species of semi-arid environments than among species of humid environments, and also differed between continents. Differences between strategies under each climate type appear to be associated with leaf habit.4. Synthesis. Plant biomass partitioning has been selected by defoliation pressure and the effects of this selection pressure can supersede any selection in response to local water constraints. Root morphological adaptations, but not plant growth rate, of tree seedlings, have been selected in response to water deficits.},

	abstract = {Allocation is one of the central concepts in modern ecology, providing the basis for different strategies. Allocation in plants has been conceptualized as a proportional or ratio-driven process (?partitioning?). In this view, a plant has a given amount of resources at any point in time and it allocates these resources to different structures. But many plant ecological processes are better understood in terms of growth and size than in terms of time. In an allometric perspective, allocation is seen as a size-dependent process: allometry is the quantitative relationship between growth and allocation. Therefore most questions of allocation should be posed allometrically, not as ratios or proportions. Plants evolve allometric patterns in response to numerous selection pressures and constraints, and these patterns explain many behaviours of plant populations.
In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant's allometric trajectory in response to the environment. Some allocation patterns show relatively fixed allometric trajectories, varying in different environments primarily in the speed at which the trajectory is travelled, whereas other allocation patterns show great flexibility in their behaviour at a given size. Because plant growth is often indeterminate and its rate highly influenced by environmental conditions, ?plasticity in size? is not a meaningful concept. We need a new way to classify, describe and analyze plant allocation and plasticity because the concepts ?trait? and ?plasticity? are too broad. Three degrees of plasticity can be distinguished: (1) allometric growth (?apparent plasticity?), (2) modular proliferation and local physiological adaptation, and (3) integrated plastic responses. Plasticity, which has evolved because it increases individual fitness, can be a disadvantage in plant production systems, where we want to optimize population, not individual, performance.},

	abstract = {A fundamental tool in carbon accounting is tree-based allometry, whereby easily measured variables can be used to estimate aboveground biomass ({AGB}). To explore the potential of general allometry we combined raw datasets from 14 different woodland species, mainly eucalypts, from 11 sites across the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. Access to the raw data allowed two predictor variables, tree diameter ( at 1.3-m height; D) and tree height ( H), to be used singly or in various combinations to produce eight candidate models. Following natural log (ln) transformation, the data, consisting of 220 individual trees, were re-analysed in two steps: first as 20 species - site-specific {AGB} equations and, second, as a single general {AGB} equation. For each of the eight models, a comparison of the species - site-specific with the general equations was made with the Akaike information criterion ({AIC}). Further model evaluation was undertaken by a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. For each of the model forms, the species - site-specific equations performed better than the general equation. However, the best performing general equation, ln( {AGB})=- 2.0596+ 2.1561 ln( D)+ 0.1362 ( ln( H))(2), was only marginally inferior to the species - site-specific equations. For the best general equation, back-transformed predicted v. observed values ( on a linear scale) were highly concordant, with a slope of 0.99. The only major deviation from this relationship was due to seven large, hollow trees ( more than 35\% loss of cross-sectional stem area at 1.3 m) at a single species - site combination. Our best-performing general model exhibited remarkable stability across species and sites, when compared with the species - site equations. We conclude that there is encouraging evidence that general predictive equations can be developed across sites and species for Australia's woodlands. This simplifies the conversion of long-term inventory measurements into {AGB} estimates and allows more resources to be focused on the extension of such inventories.},

	abstract = {A number of global land surface models simulate photosynthesis, respiration, and disturbance, important flows in the carbon cycle that are widely tested against flux towers and {CO}2 concentration gradients. The resulting forest biomass is examined in this paper for its resemblance to realistic stands, which are characterized using allometric theory. The simulated biomass pools largely do not conform to widely observed allometry, particularly for young stands. The best performing models had an explicit treatment of stand-thinning processes, which brought the slope of the allometry of these models closer to observations. Additionally, models that had relatively shorter wood turnover times performed were generally closer to observed allometries. The discrepancy between the pool distribution between models and data suggests estimates of {NEE} have biases when integrated over the long term, as compared to observed biomass data, and could therefore compromise long-term predictions of land carbon sources and sinks. We think that this presents a practical obstacle for improving models by informing them better with data. The approach taken in this paper, examining biomass pools allometrically, offers a simple approach to improving the characteristic behaviors of global models with the relatively sparse data that is available globally by forest inventory.},

	abstract = {To develop a scheme for partitioning the products of photosynthesis toward different biomass components in land-surface models, a database on component mass and net primary productivity ({NPP}), collected from {FLUXNET} sites, was examined to determine allometric patterns of allocation. We found that {NPP} per individual of foliage (Gfol), stem and branches (Gstem), coarse roots (Gcroot) and fine roots (Gfroot) in individual trees is largely explained (r2 = 67?91\%) by the magnitude of total {NPP} per individual (G). Gfol scales with G isometrically, meaning it is a fixed fraction of G (25\%). Root?shoot trade-offs were manifest as a slow decline in Gfroot, as a fraction of G, from 50\% to 25\% as stands increased in biomass, with Gstem and Gcroot increasing as a consequence. These results indicate that a functional trade-off between aboveground and belowground allocation is essentially captured by variations in G, which itself is largely governed by stand biomass and only secondarily by site-specific resource availability. We argue that forests are characterized by strong competition for light, observed as a race for individual trees to ascend by increasing partitioning toward wood, rather than by growing more leaves, and that this competition strongly constrains the allocational plasticity that trees may be capable of. The residual variation in partitioning was not related to climatic or edaphic factors, nor did plots with nutrient or water additions show a pattern of partitioning distinct from that predicted by G alone. These findings leverage short-term process studies of the terrestrial carbon cycle to improve decade-scale predictions of biomass accumulation in forests. An algorithm for calculating partitioning in land-surface models is presented.},

Empirical and allometric methods are easily developed and computationally efficient, but lack the power of evolution-based approaches to explain and predict multifaceted effects of environmental variability and climate change. In evolution-based methods, allocation is usually determined by maximization of a fitness proxy, either in a fixed environment, which we call optimal response ({OR}) models, or including the feedback of an individual's strategy on its environment (game-theoretical optimization, {GTO}). Optimal response models can predict allocation in single trees and stands when there is significant competition only for one resource. Game-theoretical optimization can be used to account for additional dimensions of competition, e.g., when strong root competition boosts root allocation at the expense of wood production. However, we demonstrate that an {OR} model predicts similar allocation to a {GTO} model under the root-competitive conditions reported in free-air carbon dioxide enrichment ({FACE}) experiments. The most evolutionarily realistic approach is adaptive dynamics ({AD}) where the allocation strategy arises from eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations instead of a fitness proxy. We also discuss emerging entropy-based approaches that offer an alternative thermodynamic perspective on allocation, in which fitness proxies are replaced by entropy or entropy production. To help develop allocation models further, the value of wide-ranging datasets, such as {FLUXNET}, could be greatly enhanced by ancillary measurements of driving variables, such as water and soil nitrogen availability.},

	abstract = {Future increases in air temperature resulting from human activities may increase the water vapour pressure deficit ({VPD}) of the atmosphere. Understanding the responses of trees to spatial variation in {VPD} can strengthen our ability to predict how trees will respond to temporal changes in this important variable. Using published values, we tested the theoretical prediction that conifers decrease their investment in photosynthetic tissue (leaves) relative to water-conducting tissue in the stem (sapwood) as {VPD} increases. The ratio of leaf/sapwood area ({AL}/{AS}) decreased significantly with increasing {VPD} in Pinus species but not in Abies, Pseudotsuga, Tsuga and Picea, and the average {AL}/{AS} was significantly lower for pines than other conifers (pines: 0.17 m2 cm−2; nonpines: 0.44 m2 cm−2). Thus, pines adjusted to increasing aridity by altering above-ground morphology while nonpine conifers did not. The average water potential causing a 50\% loss of hydraulic conductivity was −3.28 {MPa} for pines and −4.52 {MPa} for nonpine conifers, suggesting that pines are more vulnerable to xylem embolism than other conifers. For Pinus ponderosa the decrease in {AL}/{AS} with high {VPD} increases the capacity to provide water to foliage without escalating the risk of xylem embolism. Low {AL}/{AS} and plasticity in this variable may enhance drought tolerance in pines. However, lower {AL}/{AS} with increasing {VPD} and an associated shift in biomass allocation from foliage to stems suggests that pines may expend more photosynthate constructing and supporting structural mass and carry less leaf area as the climate warms.},

	abstract = {Investigation of 52 trees suggests that foliage mass (kg dry weight) of individual Douglas-fir, noble fir, and ponderosa pine trees can be estimated from regressions on sapwood cross-sectional area (cm²) at dbh (1.3m). Equations are respectively y = 0.072 X -1.34, y = 0.51 X -4.63, and y = 0.043 X +7.13. Correlation coefficients (r) were 0.98 or greater. Similar relations may exist for other species having clearly defined sapwood. Forest Sci. 20:205-206.},
